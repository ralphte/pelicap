## Overview
Pelicap is a wireless pen testing hardware build. It consists of two parts, the build instructions / part list and an ansible script to configure the OS. This build is designed to be mobile and very customizable. Enterprise Wireless pentest can take a wide range of software and utilizing a laptop can be extremely cumbersome. In addition, USB Wireless support can be very frustrating no matter the platform. Even when it does work, you don’t want to carry it around on a large assessment with wires everywhere. Lastly this build allows you to have a known good wireless testing system to grab and go.

## Why
The out of box solutions suck or they’re $1000's of dollars and still suck. I am not saying this build is perfect but this build allows for the most flexibility.
