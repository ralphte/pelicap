## Overview

Pelicap is a wireless pen testing hardware build. It consists of two parts, the build instructions / part list and an Ansible script to configure the OS. This build is designed to be mobile and very customizable. Enterprise Wireless assessments can take a wide range of software and utilizing a laptop can be extremely cumbersome. In addition, USB Wireless support can be very frustrating no matter the platform. Even when it does work, you don’t want to carry it around a laptop on a large assessment with wires everywhere. Lastly this build allows you to have a known good wireless testing system to grab and go.

## Why

The out of box solutions suck or they’re $1000's of dollars and still suck. I am not saying this build is perfect but this build allows for the most flexibility. You will be able to reuse a lot of parts in the future and upgrading will not require starting over.
